# Requirements:

Display all the existing API data in the UI using Axios.
Users should be able to perform CRUD operations on user data, including adding, editing, and deleting user records.
The user data should be stored in a mock API that can be accessed using Axios fetch.
The UI should have a clean and responsive design that is easy to use and navigate.
